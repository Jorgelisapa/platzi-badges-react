# Platzi Badges

The objective of this project is to create a platform to keep track of attendees at the Platzi Conf, making it possible for each registered user to enter their personal information. Each of them will have a different role and this will be reflected in their badge. This includes a page that will allow you to list all participants and filter them by role type, or search by name.
